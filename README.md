## A Process for Assessing the Social Benefits of Ecological Restoration
This code repository contains tools and files related to the Rapid Benefit Indicators (RBI) assessment approach.

###Overview
The RBI approach is an easy-to-use process for assessing restoration sites using non-monetary benefit indicators. It uses readily-available data to estimate and quantify benefits to people around an ecological restoration site. Whether you are a federal, state, or local manager, or a member of an interest group or funding organization, this simple yet powerful site analysis will allow you and your stakeholders to systematically and equitably incorporate social benefits in restoration decisions. All materials are also accessible from [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/rapid-benefit-indicators-rbi-approach).

###RBI Approach Fact Sheet
This downloadable one-page document briefly describes the RBI approach and how it might be used. Also accessible from [US EPA](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P100PMSW.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=2011+Thru+2015&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C11thru15%5CTxt%5C00000022%5CP100PMSW.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=1&SeekPage=x&ZyPURL).

###Assessing the Benefits of Wetland Restoration - A Rapid Benefits Indicators Approach for Decision Markers
Downloadable PDF of the full EPA Report, also accessible from [US EPA](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=325010 "EPA Science Inventory").

**Description:**
This EPA report presents the RBI approach using an example application to wetland restoration. In this guide, each step of the RBI Approach is introduced by an overview section that summarizes the step and explains how to apply it. Following the full walkthrough of each step, you will find “Step in Action” pages that demonstrate how the step is applied in a real-world scenario, using an example application to freshwater wetland restoration in the Woonasquatucket River Watershed in Rhode Island, USA.

###Rapid Benefit Indicator (RBI) Checklist Tool
Interactive, Macro-Enabled Excel workbook (.xlsm). Also accessible from [US EPA](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=331110 "EPA Science Inventory").

**Description:**
This tool accompanies the guidebook and provides a way to record information and compare sites using the RBI approach. The spreadsheet-based tool includes prompts to guide you through the assessment process, and automatically summarizes entries.

###Rapid Benefit Indicators (RBI) Checklist Tool - Quick Start Manual
Downloadable PDF manual that provides guidance on using the Checklist Tool. Also accessible from [US EPA](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=331110 "EPA Science Inventory").

###Rapid Benefit Indicators (RBI) Checklist Tool - Fillable Forms
Downloadable fillable PDF version of the Checklist Tool. For an alternative to the spreadsheet-based RBI Approach Checklist Tool, these fillable, formatted sheets are available. The PDF does not have all the functionality of the spreadsheet and will only allow for the comparison of two sites at a time, but will work on systems that may not be able to run the spreadsheet-based checklist tool. Also accessible from [US EPA](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=331110 "EPA Science Inventory").

###Rapid Benefit Indicators (RBI) Spatial Analysis Toolset
The toolset and associated manual can also be accessed from [US EPA](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryId=338471).

###RBI Approach Spatial Analysis Toolset - ArcGIS toolbox
This toolset is intended to be used to analyze existing spatial information to produce metrics for the indicators developed in the RBI approach Guidebook. The RBI Spatial Analysis (.pyt) Toolbox uses ArcPy functionality within ArcGIS to run the spatial analysis. This tool can be used in place of the Checklist Tool and produces a similar formatted PDF report of results. Also accessible from [US EPA](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_file_download.cfm?p_download_id=533526).

###RBI Approach Spatial Analysis Toolset - Manual
This Spatial Analysis Toolset Manual gives directions on the mechanics of the toolbox and its data requirements. The manual does not detail the reasoning behind the indicators and how to use results of the assessment; this information is found in the RBI Approach Guidebook. Also accessible from [US EPA](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P100T7PH.txt).
