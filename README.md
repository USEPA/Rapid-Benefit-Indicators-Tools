# Rapid-Benefit-Indicators-Tools
This code repository contains tools and files related to the Rapid Benefit Indicators (RBI) assessment approach.
##Overview
The Rapid Benefit Indicators (RBI) Approach is an easy-to-use process for assessing restoration sites using nonmonetary benefit indicators. The RBI uses readily-available data to estimate and quantify benefits to people around an ecological restoration site. Whether you are a federal, state, or local manager, or a member of an interest group or funding organization, this simple yet powerful site analysis will make restoration decisions clearer for you and for stakeholders.

##Resources Included
The Rapid Benefits Indicators (RBI) approach consists of five steps as outlined in **Assessing the Benefits of Wetland Restoration â€“ A Rapid Benefits Indicators Approach for Decision Makers**, hereafter refered to as the "guide". The excel based **Rapid Benefit Indicator (RBI) Checklist Tool**, hereafter referred to as the "Checklist Tool", is intended to be used to record information as you answer the questions in the guide. The **Rapid Benefit Indicator (RBI) Checklist Tool - Quick Start Manual** gives you directions on the mechanics of the checklist tool, but does not provide guidance on performing the assessment as the guide does. If you are unable to use the Checklist Tool the formatted results sheets from the tool are also available as fillable PDF forms using **Rapid Benefit Indicator (RBI) - Fillable Forms** and as a printable appendix in the guide.
